        <h1>Early years</h1>
        <p>
            Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin 
            when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California. The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder",
            Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before
            Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow
            Garage in 2006.

            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms
             appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.
             They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance
              of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code
               to implement Page's ideas.
